### Hi there 👋

😜 Hello, I'm Fuyan Yuan 😆. I major in Computer Science in CQU(2017-2021).

------

Recently, I want to start a 💥big project -- Design a superscalar MIPS CPU, and run OS on it. This will be my graduation project. More detailed, the project is consisted of these parts:

- CPU
  - Superscalar & Out-of-order: I need to learn many things: Register renaming, ROB, etc.💦
  - branch predict: I have try this in previous pipeline CPU. There is something new to do in superscalar CPU.
  - Cache: I have finished a great cache in previous pipeline CPU.
  - TLB: I have done this in previous pipeline CPU, and I have learned a lot about virtual memory in OS.
  - Float support: I haven't done this before, but I will give it a try.
- SoC
  - Build a SoC by self.
  - Driver: Support UART, USB keyboard, VGA displayer.
- OS
  - ucore: Learn how to transplant the x86-architectured ucore used in OS experiment to MIPS.
  - linux: Overcome this challenge!🔥
- Application
  - I want to run something interesting.😋 How can I run Super Mario in an emulator without Graphic support?
- Else
  - HDL: I will use system verilog this time(or try using chisel).
  - FPGA: I will use the N4ddr board.(The board used in school's experiments)

I know this is not an easy job, but I think it's fun. If you have any great idea, please contact me. 

❤️Any suggestions will be appreciated!❤️
